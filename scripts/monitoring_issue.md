## Epic
Backend Infrastructure & Data Pipeline

## Description
Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the Dagster pipeline to ensure reliability and quick incident response.

## Background
Currently, the pipeline runs on a daily schedule but lacks:
- Proactive alerting on failures
- Performance metrics tracking
- Data freshness monitoring
- Automated health checks

## Tasks

### Dagster Asset Checks
- [ ] Add asset checks for data quality (schema compliance, required fields)
- [ ] Add freshness checks (alert if data is stale >24 hours)
- [ ] Add volume checks (alert on unexpected conference count changes)
- [ ] Add duplicate detection checks

### Monitoring Metrics
- [ ] Track scraper success/failure rates per source
- [ ] Measure execution time per asset
- [ ] Track database write throughput (conferences/minute)
- [ ] Monitor LLM API usage and costs (when extraction added)
- [ ] Track data freshness per source

### Alerting
- [ ] Set up email notifications for pipeline failures
- [ ] Add Slack integration for critical alerts (optional)
- [ ] Configure alert thresholds and severity levels
- [ ] Implement alert deduplication and throttling

### Dagster UI Enhancements
- [ ] Add custom metadata to assets (conference count, sources scraped)
- [ ] Create asset groups for logical organization
- [ ] Add descriptions and documentation links to assets
- [ ] Configure run status notifications

### Observability Integration
- [ ] Export metrics to Prometheus (optional)
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards (optional)
- [ ] Integrate with Sentry for error tracking (optional)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Asset checks run on every materialization
- [ ] Failures trigger alerts within 5 minutes
- [ ] Dashboard shows pipeline health at a glance
- [ ] Data freshness is monitored for all sources
- [ ] Alert fatigue is minimized (no false positives)

## Configuration Examples

### Asset Check
```python
from dagster import AssetCheckResult

@asset_check(asset=store_conferences)
def conference_count_check(context):
    count = get_conference_count()
    if count < 100:  # Threshold
        return AssetCheckResult(
            passed=False,
            description=f"Only {count} conferences found (expected >100)"
        )
    return AssetCheckResult(passed=True)
```

### Email Alert
```python
# dagster.yaml
run_monitoring:
  enabled: true
  alert_after_seconds: 300
  email_notifications:
    - to: alerts@confradar.com
      on_failure: true
```

## Priority
P1 - Critical for production reliability

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Notes
- Start with basic asset checks and email alerts
- Add Prometheus/Grafana integration later as needed
- Focus on actionable alerts (avoid noise)
- Document alert response procedures
