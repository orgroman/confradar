# 2025 Q4 Plan

Focus: MVP pipeline, alias/workshop clustering, and one serving target (Notion or Docs).

## Goals
- MVP ingestion → extraction → KB → change detection
- Alias/workshop clustering v1
- Serving v1 to either Notion or Google Docs

## Target issues (initial set)
- Retrieval: seeded crawling for top CS conferences (area:retrieval, priority:P1)
- Extraction: schema + LLM prompt for dates, AoE handling (area:extraction, priority:P1)
- KB: event schema + storage + last_updated (area:kb, priority:P1)
- Change detection: detect diffs in date fields (area:kb, priority:P1)
- Clustering: alias normalization rules + embeddings (area:clustering, priority:P2)
- Workshop → parent linkage by text and date/location (area:clustering, priority:P2)
- Serving: Notion database adapter OR Google Docs table writer (area:serving, priority:P1)
- Evaluation harness and sample set (area:infra, type:task, priority:P2)

Milestone: M1/M2/M3 (see ROADMAP.md)
