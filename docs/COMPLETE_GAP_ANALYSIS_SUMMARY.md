## What Was Done

Based on the **complete PRD** (confradar_prd.md + confradar_implementation_plan.md), I performed a comprehensive gap analysis and identified **23 additional issues** that were missing from the backlog.

### Previous State:
- **First gap analysis** (based only on ConfRadar.md): 17 ‚Üí 38 issues
- Focus was on orchestration, infrastructure, DevOps, testing

### Current State:
- **Complete PRD analysis** (all three documents): 38 ‚Üí **61 issues**
- Focus on Python-specific requirements, detailed implementation tasks

---

## New Issues Created (#39-#61)

### 1. Python Project Setup & Tooling (7 issues)

The PRD explicitly requires Python-based implementation. These issues set up the Python development environment:

| # | Title | Priority | Milestone |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|
| #39 | Python project structure and pyproject.toml | P0 | M1 |
| #40 | Python environment management (venv/conda) | P1 | M1 |
| #41 | Python code formatting (Black/Ruff) | P1 | M1 |
| #42 | Type checking with mypy | P2 | M1 |
| #43 | Pre-commit hooks for Python | P1 | M1 |
| #44 | Python dependency management strategy | P1 | M1 |
| #45 | Pytest configuration and fixtures | P1 | M1 |

**Why Critical:** The PRD recommends "Python as the primary language" with specific libraries (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, spaCy, LangChain, SQLAlchemy). These issues ensure proper Python project foundation.

---

### 2. Specific Data Source Scrapers (5 issues)

The Implementation Plan lists specific data sources to integrate. Previous backlog only had generic "seeded crawling."

| # | Title | Priority | Milestone |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|
| #46 | Scraper: AI Deadlines (aideadlin.es) | P0 | M2 |
| #47 | Scraper: ACL Sponsored Events | P1 | M2 |
| #48 | Scraper: ChairingTool platform | P1 | M2 |
| #49 | Scraper: ELRA conference listings (LREC) | P2 | M2 |
| #50 | Scraper: WikiCFP integration | P2 | M2 |

**Why Critical:** Each data source has unique structure and requires specific parsing logic. AI Deadlines is the easiest starting point (structured data).

---

### 3. PDF Handling (2 issues)

PRD explicitly mentions PDF CFPs as a common data source challenge.

| # | Title | Priority | Milestone |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|
| #51 | PDF text extraction pipeline | P2 | M3 |
| #52 | PDF download and caching | P2 | M2 |

**Why Important:** Many conferences publish CFPs only as PDFs. Need PyMuPDF or pdfplumber integration.

---

### 4. LLM Integration Details (3 issues)

PRD extensively details LLM usage (LangChain, OpenAI/Anthropic). Previous backlog had generic "LLM fallback."

| # | Title | Priority | Milestone |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|
| #53 | LLM API setup and configuration | P0 | M1 |
| #54 | LangChain agent framework setup | P1 | M3 |
| #55 | Extraction prompt engineering and optimization | P1 | M3 |

**Why Critical:** LLM extraction is core to handling unstructured CFPs. Need API setup, rate limiting, cost tracking, prompt optimization.

---

### 5. Evaluation & Metrics (3 issues)

Implementation Plan M6 details specific evaluation tasks. Previous backlog only had generic "Evaluation harness."

| # | Title | Priority | Milestone |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|
| #56 | Ground truth dataset curation | P1 | M6 |
| #57 | Extraction accuracy metrics (Precision/Recall) | P1 | M6 |
| #58 | Change detection latency tracking | P2 | M6 |

**Why Important:** PRD requires ">90% extraction accuracy" and "24-hour change detection latency" - need metrics to validate.

---

### 6. Database Details (2 issues)

PRD specifies PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy. Previous backlog lacked implementation details.

| # | Title | Priority | Milestone |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|
| #59 | PostgreSQL schema design documentation | P1 | M1 |
| #60 | SQLAlchemy ORM models | P0 | M2 |

**Why Critical:** ORM models are needed before any data ingestion. Schema docs define the data model.

---

### 7. Web Scraping Implementation (1 issue)

PRD recommends BeautifulSoup + Scrapy. Previous backlog lacked library-specific tasks.

| # | Title | Priority | Milestone |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|
| #61 | BeautifulSoup/Scrapy implementation | P1 | M2 |

**Why Important:** Specific library implementation details (CSS selectors, fallback strategies, encoding handling).

---
